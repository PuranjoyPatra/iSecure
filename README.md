# iSecure
This iSecure project is a log in system created using Bootstrap, PHP and MySql . i use XAMPP for local host server to run PHP and MySql.
all php files are available here.

in local machine "_dbconnect.php" and "_nav.php" files are in partial named folder. that's why in source code the path of partials are mentioned.

in local server i created "loginsys" named database and "user" named table where all sign up data are stored.
